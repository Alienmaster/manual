Main mailbox
============

Every Uberspace account gets its own mailbox in the form of ``$USER@$SERVER.uberspace.de``. For convenience reasons you can use ``$USER@uber.space`` as well to receive mails.

.. tip:: 
  Since every Uberspace account is on a different server, we implement the ``@uber.space`` addresses with a proxy server that forwards mails to the corresponding mailbox on the server.
