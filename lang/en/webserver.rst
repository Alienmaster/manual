*************
Document Root
*************

If you want to publish documents on the web, you need to place them in your account's DocumentRoot. This is a folder that you can find at ``/var/www/virtual/<USERNAME>/html/``, so if your user name is ``eliza``, this would be ``/var/www/virtual/eliza/html/``.

Files named either ``index.html`` or ``index.php`` are automatically shown when accessing ``https://eliza.uber.space``.
