If you've opened this page, you probably know already how to use a Linux account and only need a few details to get startet.

Websites
========

If you want to publish a website using your Uberspace, you can do so by placing your files in the Document Root, which is `/var/www/virtual/$USER/html`. For convenience, there is also a symbolic link in your home folder (`~/html`).

Domains
=======

You can use your own domains with your Uberspace. Please refer to the relevant `web server <web-domains.html>`_ and `mail server <mail-domains.html>`_ articles to find out how.
