Introduction
============

Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. Interally, it
uses a virtual machine, making "compiled" java programs very independent of the
actual hardware executing them.

We provide the JRE / Java Runtime Environment (``java``), but not the JDK / Java
Development Kit (``javac``). If you need the latter, contact us, so we can add
it.

Versions
========

We only provide the version available in CentOS 7.

Update Policy
-------------

Java is updated alongside the rest of CentOS 7 reglarily.
