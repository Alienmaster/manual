Changed
-------
* Added a link to our status page (`is.uberspace.online`_) to the *motd*.

Fixed
-----
* Prevented Ansible from automatic type-casting variables (which could lead to
  errors with ``uberspace`` commands for certain edge cases).
* We now show an error message, if you try to remove a non existent web backend.
