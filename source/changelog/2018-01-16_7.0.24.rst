Added
-----

* All servers now come with pandoc (to convert document formats), tree (to view your directory structures in a pretty way), and imapsync (to transfer emails between IMAP accounts) installed.
* We now provide development headers for the ncurses GUI library.
* We now provide the “gmp” module for php.
* For your network debugging needs, we now offer traceroute and mtr.

Changed
-------

* The $PATH of qmail is now extended by standard directories like /bin, so maildrop can be called without specifying its full path.
* We now automatically restart php-fpm of your web services on updates or when new php modules are added.
* Apache now uses the “event” multi processing module instead of the old “prefork”. This allows us to handle more requests in parallel.
* The number of HTTP slots, which can be used by a single uberspace is now limited, so a single uberspace cannot overload our webservers.

Fixed
-----

* After numerous attempts to install “git submodules” and various other git sub-commands, we now got it. finally. maybe.
* On reboot, supervisord user services might be started before MySQL, causing some of them to fail. They are now only started, once MySQL is fully booted.
* Generating the nginx config takes too long in some cases, causing a timeout and nginx to be permanently down. We increased the timeout. The faulty script will be optimized at a later date.
