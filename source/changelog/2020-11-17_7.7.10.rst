Added
-----

* `mg <http://homepage.boetes.org/software/mg/>`_: a tiny Emacs-like editor
* ``numactl`` command to please MongoDB
* modern TLS settings for POP3/IMAP/SMTP-SUBMIT (reverted because they block
  connections from thunderbird)
* ``opus``, ``opus-tools``, and ``opus-devel``
* many fonts to support non-western scripts

Fixed
-----

* MariaDB backups now includestored routines
* ``table_definition_cache`` is now ``20000`` to meet friendica's requirements
* The SMTP connection limit introduced in v7.7.7 now actually works.
* ``$user.uber.space`` is now correctly displayed in ``uberspace mail domain list``
* ``uberspace * domain list`` output is now sorted

Internal
--------

* Log rotation is now randomized to happen between 4 and 5 am. The time is
  constant for each host, so they are always rotated at the same time for a
  given host. This reduces the IO load on our storage and therefore improves
  performance and reliabilty at night.
* Prometheus' node_exporter can now be monitored by our icinga2 setup, leading
  to more complete graphs for us and better performance for you.
* Sometimes our internal CI amassed a lot of temporary DNS records, which
  exceeded the quota of our DNS provider, griding our CI and development to a
  halt. The records are now purged reguarly.
