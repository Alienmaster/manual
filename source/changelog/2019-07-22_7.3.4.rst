This was mostly a maintainance release, containing internal CI releated things. But it also contains theseâ€¦

Fixed
=====

- We promise a log retention period of 7 days in `our manual <https://manual.uberspace.de/web-logs.html#privacy>`_. For a while we only kept logs for 5 days though. This is now fixed.

Added
=====

- We provide the Ada compiler `gnat <https://www.gnu.org/software/gnat/>`_.

Changed
=======

- We include `luarocks <https://luarocks.org/>`_ in ``PATH`` and also set the ``LUA_PATH`` / ``LUA_CPATH`` environment variables.
