Added
-----

* In preparation for a public status dashboard, our servers now have additional black box monitoring.
* Popular default ports like 9001 are now blocked. 

Changed
-------

* The maximum number of processes/threads is now 400 instead of 300, which allows weechat to be compiled using linuxbrew.

Fixed
-----

* Usernames did have a minimal length of two. This is wrong. We changed it to one, so it matches Uberspace 6.
* Because of an oversight, VMailMgr was never correctly set up for existing users users. This has been corrected.
* The vMailMgr wrappers now support Unicode and the char–limits for password have been removed. A warning is displayed though, if non–ASCII chars are used.
