Added
-----
* Two new VMs: ``bernardi.uberspace.de`` and ``hernmann.uberspace.de``.

Changed
-------
* After increasing the max value for **PHP-FPM** workers to 50 (up from 10) in
  ``v7.5.1``, we now tuned it down to 20.
* For *MariDB* we increased ``max_connections`` (to 2000, was 400) and
  ``max_user_connections`` (to 100, was 20).
