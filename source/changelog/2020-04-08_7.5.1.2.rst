Added
-----
* Some development packages: ``irssi-devel``, ``jq-devel``, ``libyaml-devel``,
  ``poppler-devel`` and ``wkhtmltopdf-devel``.

Changed
-------
* We decreased ``process_idle_timeout`` for **PHP-FPM** workers to 180 seconds
  (down from 900). This reduces the time a spawned child has to be idle before
  it will be killed (to accomodate for the increase in allowed childs).
