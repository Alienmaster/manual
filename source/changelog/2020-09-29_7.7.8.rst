Added
-----

* `deno <https://manual.uberspace.de/lang-deno.html>`_ JavaScript/TypeScript runtime
* ``nagios-plugins-http``
* ``rclone``
* re-added support for Sieve. We had to remove it shortly after the rollout in
  v7.7.7 because it was incompatible with mailboxes that contain a dot, e.g.
  ``isabell.hacker@something.org``. This is now fixed. Documentation and an
  announcement will follow.

Fixed
-----

* When we do not know a domain, we display a helpful "sorry, unknown domain.
  here is how you add it" page. This page doesn't have a valid certificate,
  but HTTPS was still enforced. The page can now also be opened using HTTP.
* ``MX`` records can be in any case, i.e. ``10 TUTTLe.uberspace.DE`` is now
  considered valid.
* The default "there is no content" page is no longer shown, if there is a
  ``index.php`` providing content. In the past the ``index.html`` added by us
  was considered more important by httpd. We now add a ``nocontent.html``, which
  is always queried last.

Changed
-------

* ruby 2.4 users have been migrated to version 2.7.
* nodejs 13 users have been migrated to version 14.
* The 500 Internal Server Error page now shows information on how to disable it.
* Updated HTTPS ciphers and settings to match current mozilla recommendations.

Internal
--------

* Removed an unused 3rd-party YUM repo
* We continued to restructure our repository to split it up into smaller
  modules in the future. This will enable us to make quicker releases in the
  future.
