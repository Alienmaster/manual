Added
-----

* We now support maildrop, which enables you to apply advanced filtering to incoming mails.
* Common errors like configuring the permissions on your home directory to be too open are now detected and corrected silently. A notification mechanism will be added later.

Changed
-------

* Domains without explicit NS-Records were not able to receive emails. We now ask for SOA instead. 

Fixed
-----

* An erroneous systemd configuration caused the mail service to quit when it was reloaded during manual intervention. The configuration has been updated to state that the service does not support reloads.
