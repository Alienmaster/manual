This release fixes some issues with supervisord and the firewall:

Changed
-------
* set dummy user & password for supervisord's http server
* move `supervisord <https://manual.uberspace.de/daemons-supervisord.html>`_ socket out of users home directory because supervisord became uncontrollable when users deleted ``$HOME/tmp/supervisor.sock``


Fixed
-----
* fix race condition in mail limiter
* make `open ports <https://manual.uberspace.de/basics-ports.html>`_ available via IPv6
