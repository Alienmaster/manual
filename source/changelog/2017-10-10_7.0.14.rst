Added
-----

* We now provide ``zsh``.
* Our brand new ``uberspace`` command.

Changed
-------

* We replaced ``user.server.uberspace.de`` with ``user.uber.space`` in the webserver config.
* We migrated all ``uberspace-*-*`` tools to the new ``uberspace`` command.
* The ``max_allowed_packet`` setting for MySQL is ``16777216`` now to allow importing large database dumps.

Fixed
-----

* ``uberspace web domain list`` now includes ``user.uber.space``.
*  We did not apply the MySQL config file properly, therefore ``innodb_file_format`` was not set. It is ``Barracuda`` now.
