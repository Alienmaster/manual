Added
-----
* *HTTP* outgoing headers can how be changed and set using
  ``uberspace web header``
  (`manual entry <https://manual.uberspace.de/web-headers.html>`_).
* *MySQL* `event scheduler <https://mariadb.com/kb/en/events/>`_ is now enabled.
* *ImageMagick* v7 now has
  `HEIC <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Image_File_Format>`_
  support.
* `Redis <https://redis.io/>`_ is preinstalled.

Changed
-------
* *Java* is now version 14 and will be updated as EPEL's
  ``java-latest-openjdk`` updates.
* *tmux* is now version 2.9a.
* *HSTS* is enforced for 1 year.
* *HTTPâ‡’HTTPS* redirects use 301 instead of 302.

Fixed
-----
* *SMTP* on port 587 now no longer accepts mails to local domains without
  authentication.
* *SMTP* on port 25 now automatically restarts, should it crash for any reason.
  The recent SSD migrations caused it to crash once on each host leading to a
  downtime of ~10 minutes. This change mitigates this on future crashes.
