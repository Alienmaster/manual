Added
-----
* HTTP outgoing headers can how be changed and set using ``uberspace web header``
* MySQL event scheduler is now enabled
* ImageMagick7 now has HEIC support
* redis is preinstalled

Changed
-------
* Java is now version 14 to 15 and so on and will be updated as EPEL's ``java-latest-openjdk`` updates
* tmux is now version 2.9a
* HSTS is enforced for 1 year
* HTTP=>HTTPS redirects use 301 instead of 302

Fixed
-----
* SMTP 587 now no longer accepts mails to local domains without authentication.
* SMTP 25 now automatically restarts, should it crash for any reason. The recent SSD migrations caused it to crash once on each host leading to a downtime of ~10 minutes. This change mitigates this on future crashes.
