Added
-----
* *Nginx*  serves images like *favicons* compressed (``image/x-icon``,
  ``image/svg+xml``).

Changed
-------
* We decreased our global `Rspamd <https://rspamd.com/>`_ **reject score** to
  ``10`` (down from ``15``). This means, that we reject mails percieved as spam
  sooner.

* When adding new mail domains with ``uberspace mail domain â€¦``, we now first
  ask the DNS resolver for the ``MX`` records, and only fall back to
  our old behaviour (i.e. querying the responsible nameservers directly), when
  this fails (meaning the record does not point to the host).

  This allows for edge cases, like when a person is using the NSEntry service of
  DENIC where the TLD nameservers directly hands out all records.
