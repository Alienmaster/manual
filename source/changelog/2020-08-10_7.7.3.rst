Added
-----
* *Nginx*  serves *favicons* and *SVGs* compressed (``image/x-icon``,
  ``image/svg+xml``).

Changed
-------
* We decreased our global `Rspamd <https://rspamd.com/>`_ **reject score** to
  ``10`` (down from ``15``). This means, that we reject mails percieved as spam
  sooner.

* When adding new mail domains with ``uberspace mail domain â€¦``, we now first
  ask the DNS resolver for the ``MX`` records, and only fall back to our old
  behaviour (i.e. querying the responsible nameservers directly), when this
  fails (meaning the record does not point to the host). This allows for edge
  cases, like when a person is using the NSEntry service of DENIC where the TLD
  nameservers directly hands out all records.

* Error pages generated by the Apache webserver now display
  ``<username>@uber.space`` instead of ``hallo@uberspace.de`` as a means of
  contact. Users of users kept asking our support about issues we cannot resolve
  for them, because they aren't our customers. The new mail address directs them
  to the right person.

Internal
--------

* We added a script to clean up DNS records created during our internal testing
  process. This will lead to more time spend building features and less time
  debugging the DNS.

* Configuration for the Apache webserver is now generated for all users before
  the server starts, instead of on account creation. This way we can easily
  change the configuration file in the future. Other services already use this
  scheme.
