Added
-----
* Support for Haskell, via `Haskell Platform <https://www.haskell.org/platform/>`_.
* ``ksh`` - the `KornShell <http://www.kornshell.org/>`_.
* ``emacs`` - an `editor <https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/>`_ (among other things).
* ``js`` - Netscape's JavaScript interpreter.
* The *php-dba* database abstraction layer module for PHP ``7.{2,3,4}``.
* Dependencies for *Chrome headless*.

Fixed
-----
* Unified the *regular expression* used to guard **web header** input for the
  ``uberspace web header â€¦`` command. The one used for the ``set`` and
  ``suppress`` sub-commands was stricter, than the one used for ``set``. This
  allowed setting headers, that could neither be deleted nor suppressed.
