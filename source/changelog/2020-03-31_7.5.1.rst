Added
-----
* **Ruby** ``2.7``.
* `PHP decimal <http://php-decimal.io/>`_ for all **PHP** versions, supported by
  us.
* *Sodium* for **PHP** ``7.4``.
* `ghostscript <https://www.ghostscript.com/>`_.
* `textpos <https://www.ctan.org/pkg/textpos>`_.

Changed
-------
* The default **PHP** version for new users is now ``7.4`` (was ``7.2``).
* We allow up to 50 **PHP-FPM** workers (up from 10).

Fixed
-----
* Enable lingering for user processes. This should prevent processes, that are
  inside the user slice but outside a session scope, from being killed, when no
  user sessions are active.
* Prevent our health-check script from creating empty ``~/.my.cnf`` files, if
  a user removed it. This will also prevent changed access timestamps on those
  files.

Deprecated
----------
* **Ruby** ``2.4``.
