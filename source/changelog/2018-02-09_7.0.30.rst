Changed
-------

* If a domain is accepted by nginx, we now always provide a let's encrypt certificate for it trough auto-ssl. We hope this will prevent the case, where sometimes a correctly added domain won't get a certificate. 
* As promised in 7.0.24 the nginx config generation now happens way faster, resulting in quicker reboots und easier debugging.
