Added
-----

* libgdiplus
* libacl

Fixed
-----

* ``uberspace web header set`` now correctly processes entries with special
  characters.
* Web Backends now no longer match `/etherpad_test` for a backend that was
  set on `/etherpad`. Additionally, requests to `/etherpad` are redirected
  to `/etherpad/`.

Changed
-------

* Node.js version 13 is now deprecated
* HTTP status 500 responses are now replaced with a custom error page
  showing instructions how to resolve the error. This can be disabled using
  the new ``uberspace web errorpage`` command.

Internal
--------

* We started to restructure our repository to split it up into smaller
  modules in the future. This will enable us to make quicker releases in the
  future.
* MySQL backups are now dumped at a random time each night, taking load off
  our storage system by distributing the resulting peaks better.
* The NFS mount ``/backup`` is now monitored via icinga2, helping us to
  fix it faster when it hangs.
* We use a simple watchdog to restart httpd/nginx automatically in case
  they do no longer respond to requests. Its checking turned out to be too
  aggressive, resulting in a restart loop in rare cases. We now wait for
  the server to recover before attempting another check/restart.
