Added
-----
- We included the official RPM repository for the **Mercurial SCM**. So ``hg``
  now comes in version ``5.4.2`` (was ``2.6.2``).

- `Erlang <https://manual.uberspace.de/lang-erlang.html>`_ version ``23``.

- We provide ``devtoolset-9`` (enabled by default). Resulting in more recent
  versions of development tooling (e.g. ``gcc`` in version ``9.3``).

Changed
-------
- Incoming connections directed to a
  `user's port <https://manual.uberspace.de/basics-ports.html>`_ will no longer
  be masqueraded, meaning users processes can now acces the *public client IP*.

- We set ``underscores_in_headers on`` in our *Nginx* configuration, so that
  headers containing underscores are no longer discarded.

- The configuration prefix for **Node.js** is no longer hardcoded to
  ``/home/$USER``, but mearly defaults to it. This means users can now use the
  ``NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX`` environment variable, to set their own prefix.

Fixed
-----
- We made the part of our ``uberspace`` command that parses user settings from
  YAML files more resistant, so it should no longer bail over corrupted
  files.
