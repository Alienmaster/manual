Added
-----

* The changelog is now linked in the sidebar navigation.
* We provide ``git`` version 2 from `IUS repo <https://ius.io/GettingStarted/>`_.
* We now set ``session.use_strict_mode = 1`` in global ``php.ini`` to combat session fixation attacks.

Fixed
-----

* nginx and php log errors to different files now.
* php session files are getting cleaned up now.
* We changed our ``ssl_ciphers`` to make it possible for ``java8`` to connect via HTTPS.
* Apache does not parse IP addresses in ``x-forwarded-for`` headers correctly, this is a bug in `mod_rpaf <https://github.com/gnif/mod_rpaf/pull/45>`_. To work around that we disabled ``keepalive`` between Apache<=>nginx (not nginx<=>users) for now.
* Many connections to a single virtualhost can shut down the whole webserver. We now rate-limit the maximum connections for each user.
