Added
-----

* Support for managed Sieve
* Mails from spam folder are now auto-expunged after 30 days.
* Add special RFC 6154 folders to Dovecot config, so mail clients detect trash,
  spam, and other default folders automatically.

Changed
-------

* We now keep logs for incoming mails for 10 days instead of one day to aid
  debugging of missing mails in support.
* System logs are now kept for one to two days, instead of just one.

Internal
--------

* MySQL backups are now monitored, alerting us when the process stops working.
* Optimized log output of our scripts, so we can keep the useful logs for
  longer.
* Instead of reloading nginx after log rotation, we now call ``nginx -s reopen``
  to reduce load spikes and thus increase reliability.
* We now run fstrim regularly to free unused storage in our ceph cluster. This
  enables us to use it more efficiently.
