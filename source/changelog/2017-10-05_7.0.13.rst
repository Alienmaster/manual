Changed
-------

* Webserver: Several users ran into ``429`` errors. We removed the connection limits for now and will look into that later. 

Fixed
-----

* Apache and PHP: ``ProxyPassMatch`` directives are evaluated first, this brings several problems: for instance ``.htaccess`` files can't be evaluated anymore before the PHP scripts are run. Using ``FilesMatch`` and ``SetHandler`` solves the issue.
