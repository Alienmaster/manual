Prolog
######

Introduction
============

Prolog is a declarative programming language that unlike other languages uses
relations expressed in facts and rules to compute its logic. On Uberspace we use
the `SWI implementation <https://www.swi-prolog.org/>`_  of Prolog.

Versions
========

We only provide the `latest version <https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/swipl/tags>`_ of swi-prolog from the stable branch.
